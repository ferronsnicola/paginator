WebApp to prepare custom boardgame cards for high quality printing

You can upload your decks specifying the name of it, an image file for the back of the deck's cards, and a folder that contains the images front files.
After uploading decks, you can select the printing formats, like plotter height/width, cards height/widht and some other graphics that could help to cut the cards after the print!
For each uploaded deck, you could see an item that shows its name, back file and a front file sample, you could also delete it if you made a mistake!
